# CoronaUpdates
Repo containing work done for week 18 mandatory assignment in IOS development, Computer Science.


## Solution
I've made a Corona Tracker app, that leverages information from the [Coronatracker API](http://covidtracking.com/api/) to display current information about the Corona outbreak in the U.S.


## Assignment description:

> The task is to build an app for quarantine situations, like the current one. People could use some encouragement during such an unusual period. 
> It is up to you to decide, what the app should do. You are welcome to use any previous code/projects as starting point. 
>
> Possible ideas, relating to the current situation (Covid-19):
> - Map with interesting places to go, which are not affected by the quarantine
> - Some service to make it easier for neighbors to get to know each other
> - Health resources 
> - Global statistics (live data)
> - Collection of high-quality scientific sites 
> - Collection of high-quality political discussions
> - "Healthy" entertainment: that is online resources.
>
> Feel free to come up with your own idea
